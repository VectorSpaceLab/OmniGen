    "\n",
    "Some tips for generation:\n",
    "- For out of memory or time cost, you can set `offload_model=True` or refer to [./docs/inference.md#requiremented-resources](https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/OmniGen/blob/main/docs/inference.md#requiremented-resources) to select a appropriate setting.\n",
    "- If the inference time is too long when input multiple images, you can reduce the `max_input_image_size`. More detaild pleae refer to [./docs/inference.md#requiremented-resources](https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/OmniGen/blob/main/docs/inference.md#requiremented-resources)\n",
    "- Oversaturated: If the image appears oversaturated, please reduce the `guidance_scale`.\n",
    "- Not match the prompt: If the image does not match the prompt, please try to increase the `guidance_scale`.\n",
    "- Low-quality: More detailed prompt will lead to better results. \n",
    "- Animate Style: If the genereate images is in animate style, you can try to add `photo` to the prompt`.\n",
    "- Edit generated image. If you generate a image by omnigen and then want to edit it, you cannot use the same seed to edit this image. For example, use seed=0 to generate image, and should use seed=1 to edit this image.\n",
    "- For image editing tasks, we recommend placing the image before the editing instruction. For example, use `<img><|image_1|></img> remove suit`, rather than `remove suit <img><|image_1|></img>`. \n",
    "- For image editing task and controlnet task, we recommend to set the height and width of output image as the same\n",
    "as input image. For example, if you want to edit a 512x512 image, you should set the height and width of output image as 512x512. You also can set the `use_input_image_size_as_output` to automatically set the height and width of output image as the same as input image."
